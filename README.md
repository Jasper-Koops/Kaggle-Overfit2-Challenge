## README

This repo contains the code for my submissions to the kaggle [Don't Overfit II!](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dont-overfit-ii) challenge. 
Though I've published a [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/jasperkoops/logistic-model-with-pipeline) on kaggle I'll use github as the main repository 


### Run

The `input` folder contains the data and the `kernels` folder contains both the kernels used and the submission file. 
The notebook has been configured with these folders / locations in mind and should work as long as you dont move anything around.
